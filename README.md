Matching Game
****
This matching game consists of 3 main files: index.html, style.css, and game.js. 
The settings.json was created to run my liveserver to help create the game.

The main objective is to match each sports card (pictures represented with emojis) using the least amount of moves in the quickest time possible.

The first step is to click the "Start" button which will begin the clock. 

Using your mouse, click on a card. The card will flip over and show the represented sports emoji. It's a good idea to try and remember the location of this card for later if the next card does not match. 

After each card is matched to it's identical counterpart; the game is over! Your stats will be displayed once the final card is matched.
